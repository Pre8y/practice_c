1.create header .h file first, give function prototype with extern variable;
2. create .c file for the same header file where you have to give funciton definition, don't forget to include "your.h" file. <> stands for system file while ""stand for local files.
3.once done now you can use the methods of .h file in your main function file by including the .h file
4. create object .o file for your_header_def.c then create object file for your main file
	gcc -c -g header.c //generate header.o
	gcc -c -g main.c //generate main.o
5.Now link both of the object file
	gcc -o main main.o header.o
6. run the executable ./main
